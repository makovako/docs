## Cheaper alternatives to fuel my body for long rides?

> This is my base recipe:
>
> 150g dates, 250g oatmeal (small flakes), 150g agave nectar (has a neutral taste, you can also use honey), 50g suger, 40g oil (sunflower for example), Pinch of salt, 75g chopped nuts. Almonds work well.
>
> Then for a nice taste: 1 big brown banana, Lots of cinnamon, Bit of cardamom, Sometimes a little water to make the mixture sticky
>
> Or: 2 appels Bit of citrus juice Cinnamon is nice
>
> Or: Chocolate flakes Raspberry extract
>
> Or: Be creative ðŸ™‚
>
> Howto: Chop the nuts, dades and banana. Mix it all together in a bowl with the oatmeal. Warm-up the nectar with suger and oil in a pan. Mix it all together, you should get a nice solid, sticky mixture.
>
> Spread it in a baking dish with anti stick paper (sorry don't know the correct name) and put it in the oven for 30 minutes at 160 degrees celcius.
>
> Let the mixture cool down completely before cutting it into squares. Wrap the bars in plastic and you are done. I store them in the refrigerator.[^1]
