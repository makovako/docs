## Introduction

I always wanted to have some sort of central point for all of my notes and other information gathered throughout the years on the internet. Majority of such content is from public sources, so there is no need to keep it private, stored on some offline media or in random applications.

For a long time I wasn't sure, what would be the best way to store and display my notes. Is it a forum, a website, which one of those thousands of applications will solve this problem. I am even not sure now, if this way will be good, but let's try it. Some of my notes were already migrated many times between applications, thanks to markdown format, it was easy. But there are still pieces all around my harddrives and archives, I think I have some export of my bookmarks from years ago, which needs to be sorted.

Originally, I wanted to create my own system to catalog my notes. Don't know why, it sounded like good idea to learn something new. But years had gone by and no progress was made, just applications switching rules and features, making me find another one. This solution, using a website, which I doesn't need to maintain much, but I can customize it, it doesn't cost much/anything, looks currently like the best solution.

Let's go, another migration ahead of me. Especially making my notes pretty and public friendly will be a challenge. Notes from tutorials, random recipes, books read, youtube moments, random reddit posts, documenting my projects and works, which I am very bad at and eats time each time I want to continue on something after a while or want to repeat something, but don't remember how, all of this I want to put here. It will be a long and never ending journey, but I am looking forward to find stuff lost for years, random links to sites, that might not even exist anymore, let's see.
