## ELI5: How does diarrhea work?

> Reposted by /u/jiggity_gee
>
> So your bowels are like a long train track and your food is like a set of cars on the track. Transit time between Point A, your mouth, and Point B, the chute, is a bit flexible but normally operates on a regularly scheduled basis.
>
> When you eat, you put cars on the track and send them to Point B. As these cars go to Point B, they lose passengers (nutrients) at various points in the thin tunnel portion (small intestine). The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color. Once in the larger portion of the tunnel, the cars are checked for stray passengers and are hosed down a bit so that transition out of Point B isn't so bad. Sometimes, the train cars park juuust outside the gates of Point B so they can exit at the best time for the operator (toilet).
>
> Now, all of this goes fucking nuts when you load a bad set of train cars at Point A. The track sensors located everywhere along the track, detect this alien set of cars and sends a distress call to the Supervisor (your brain). The Supervisor wants to handle the situation without having to phone the Manager (your consciousness) about the craziness on the tracks and also wants to make sure you never know it was on the tracks. It has to make a choice now: send it back to Point A violently and somewhat painfully risking tearing the tracks, or send it to Point B as fast as fuck? Depending on where it's located on the track, it'll choose the best route.
>
> Let's use the destination Point B. The Supervisor hits the panic button and puts all the train cars that are on the track (in your body) on overdrive. The tunnels are flooded with water and lubricant to speed all the cars up and get them the hell out of there as quickly as possible. Cars collide with each other, and previously well formed cars are just flooded with water and lubricant that they are just a soggy, shadowy reminder of their former glory state.
>
> The Media (pain) hears about the car collisions immediately begins filming live the high speed, flooded train cars out of control. They want to knos how an alien set of train cars were put on the tracks and they want someone to pay for such carelessness. The Manager is just watching the horror unfold on Live TV but cannot do anything to stop it, because the Supervisor was deaf and he had not installed a means of communicating with him after hours in the office.
>
> I hope this answers your question.
>
> TL;DR when you get diarrhea, everything gets pushed out, one way or another. There are no passing lanes.

## ELI5: What does zipping a file actually do? Why does it make it easier for sharing files, when essentially you’re still sharing the same amount of memory?

> Suppose you have a .txt file with partial lyrics to The Rolling Stones’ song ‘Start Me Up’:
>
> > If you start me up If you start me up I'll never stop If you start me up If you start me up I'll never stop I've been running hot You got me ticking gonna blow my top If you start me up If you start me up I'll never stop never stop, never stop, never stop*
>
> Now let’s do the following:
>
> let xxx = ‘If you start me up’;
>
> let yyy = ‘never stop’;
>
> So we represent this part of the song with xxx and yyy, and the lyrics become:
>
> > xxx xxx I'll yyy xxx xxx I'll yyy I've been running hot You got me ticking gonna blow my top xxx xxx I'll yyy yyy, yyy, yyy*
>
> Which gets you a smaller net file size with the same information.[^2]

## ELI5: Can someone give me an understanding of why we need 3 terms to explain electricity (volts,watts, and amps)?

> Think of a pipe that we're going to pump water through.
>
> Now imagine you put your face at the open end of the pipe.
>
> The voltage is the pressure the pump puts in. The pressure will drop depending how long the pipe is.
>
> The current is the amount of water that moves through the pipe per second, the flow rate.
>
> The watts is how hard it hits you in the face, or how much it pushes you back.
>
> I could send a low pressure and high flow rate and you'd have a shower. Or I could send a high pressure and the same flow rate and pressure wash your back deck.[^3]

## ELI5: Difference between AM and FM ?

> Imagine for a moment you wanted to communicate to your friend next door by yelling in morse code.
>
> At first, you tried just yelling louder and softer.
>
> AAAaaaAAAAAAaaa
>
> This works, but it has problems. It gets more easily confused by distance or noise.
>
> So you switch to changing your pitch instead of volume.
>
> AAAEEEAAAAAAEEE
>
> The first is AM, or amplitude modulation. The second is FM, or frequency modulation. [^4]

## ELI5: why do people’s voices sound so different in their heads as compared to in recordings?

> The voice we hear when we speak travels through muscle and bone to reach our ears. This makes it sound deeper than it really is. This deeper version is what we get used to and build our speech patterns around.
>
> As for why people don't like it, it's because it's unfamiliar. It's close enough to recognize it as you, but just different enough to feel "wrong."
>
> This is similar to why many people don't like the way they look in pictures. The only time they see themselves is in a mirror so they get used to the reversed image of themselves. Not better, not worse, just different. [^5]

## ELI5: Why are solar panels only like ~20% efficient (i know there's higher and lower, but why are they so inefficient, why can't they be 90% efficient for example) ?

> Physics and cost.
>
> The theoretical efficiency limit is 95%. This is solely determined by the temperature of the sun and the temperature of earth. Whatever you do, a higher efficiency is never possible.
>
> However, there are a couple of limitations. First, the solar panel has to send out light as well: the temperature of the panel is above absolute zero, so it emits heat. This brings it down to 86.8%. But that assumes that the incoming light comes from every direction at once. In practice, the sun only covers a small part of the sky, bringing it even further down to 68.7%. And that's still with a perfect solar cell! That assumes the cell is infinitely thick and has zero losses.
>
> If we try to actually build cells, the best we can currently do is around 44.4%, which isn't too bad! But those cells consist of multiple layers, use exotic materials, and are very expensive to construct. It is way cheaper to construct less complicated cells. Turns out we don't really care about the absolute efficiency: there is plenty of sunlight available. We just want the most power at the lowest cost.
>
> The most common (and cheapest) cell type is "single-junction". The theoretical efficiency limit for those is 33.16%. Then we have some losses due to the protective coating, the wiring, being unable to cover 100% of the panel with cells, and loooots of other small stuff.
>
> So yeah, it might not sound like much, but an efficiency in the 20ish% isn't too bad. Don't expect anything over 30% soon, because we're already rapidly approaching the limits of physics! [^6]

## ELI5: How are CPUs and GPUs different in build? What tasks are handled by the GPU instead of CPU and what about the architecture makes it more suited to those tasks?

> My favorite description was that a CPU is like having someone with a PhD per core. A gpu is like having an army of millions of kindergarteners. Want to do complex math on a lot of data? Hand it to the 8 PhDs. Want to fill in a bunch of tiny spots with a different color? Pitch it to the kindergarteners. [^7]

## ELI5: The difference between a router, switch, hub, a bridge and a modem

> Edit: Network traffic broken into packets, which you can think of like a letter in an envelope. The letter is your data (like a Google query) and the envelope has a 'to' and 'from' line to help know how to forward it on. All those devices have different techniques for knowing how and where to forward an envelope onto, once they get it.
>
> Hub: Make a copy of a letter and give it to every one of your neighbors with a t-shirt cannon, whether you meant to give it to them or not
>
> Switch: Make a copy of your letter and use a map to drive it to a specific neighbor
>
> Bridge: When you want to give a letter to Billy the next neighborhood over, so you give it to his brother who lives right in-between the two neighborhoods
>
> Router: Send your letter to the post office, and they'll send it to your grandma by forwarding it to her post office and then driving it to her house using a map
>
> Gateway: The post office in your neighborhood
>
> Modem: Send your letter to the post office by saying it over the phone to a postal worker, where they type and print it off and forward it on[^8]

## ELI5: Where do all the wasps and bees go, when it gets cold, do they hibernate?

> In honeybees, all the worker bees (the females) will pick up the drones (the males) and drop them outside the hive to die so they don’t eat all the food during the winter! Then, they all get in a big cluster (like a basketball) around the queen bee, and they vibrate to keep warm. The bees all trade spots in the ball so no one gets to cold, and they travel in formation around the hive really slowly throughout the winter to eat the food they’ve stored. Once it gets warm enough, they break cluster and complete an elimination flight (which means they all fly outside and poop for the first time since fall!) [^9]

## ELI5: Why is - 1 X - 1 = 1 ?

> Imagine you are watching a movie. The first number is how the person in the movie is moving. The second number is how you are watching the film (normal or in reverse).
>
> 1 x 1 is a person walking forward, you watch it normal. Answer is you see a person walking forward, which is 1.
>
> 1 x -1 is a person walking forward, you watch it in reverse. You see a person walking backwards. -1
>
> -1 x 1 is a person walking backward, you watch it normal. You see a person walking backwards. -1
>
> -1 x -1 is a person walking backwards, but you watch it in reverse. What you will see is a person that looks like they are walking forward. 1 [^10]

## ELI5: 4 continuous hours in the sun results in a sunburn, but 4 hours broken up into 15 minutes chunks does not.

> The explanations so far are not correct. 4 continuous hours of sunlight will give your damaged cells less time to repair DNA and less time to apoptose (safely die without causing inflammation).
>
> 4 hours spread out over increments gives your cells time to repair DNA and, if need be, apoptose irreparable cells in-between exposures.
>
> If you do not have this break time in-between exposures, cells will become damaged so badly that they cannot die in a safe, organized manner (apoptosis). Instead, they die quicker and release their proteins into the space between cells. Nearby cells sense this, freak out and release chemicals that cause inflammation and pain.
>
> Additionally, immune cells in skin undergoing DNA damage from UV may directly contribute to inflammation.
>
> Fun fact: When you feel heat, when you are out in the sun, it’s from infrared light. A lot of people have the misconception that they aren’t feeling the heat from the sun, so they aren’t getting burned. The “heat” (really just pain) from a sunburn will come on much later, and is produced by inflammation and hypersensitive nerve endings. [^11]

## ELI5: the difference between 4 Wheel Drive and All Wheel Drive.

## ELI5: Why do we wake up starving the morning after a night of binge eating?

> Insulins fucked it up.
>
> Your body needs glucose for energy. Everything you eat is broken down into glucose.
>
> 1. Foods like "sugary" foods, starch or very simple carbohydrates like rice, bread, pasta, etc, are digested very fast and thus, broken down and turned into glucose very fast.
>
> 2. Now, when you eat lots of those foods, lots of glucose goes into your blood very fast. And your pancrea produce little guys (hormones) called insulins who push that glucose into your cells.
>
> 3. When lots of glucose goes into your blood very fast, your organ pancrea freaks out and is like "OMFG! Too much glucose in the blood. Too much glucose wandering around in the blood = poison!! Guys!!, Insulins!!, go go go!!! Go push them into the muscle cells and fat cells to properly store them." and then Pancrea produce lots of fucking insulins. May be even too much insulins.
>
> 4. Those lots of little fuckers called insulins push all the glucose from your blood into the cells.
>
> 5. Then, very low level of glucose in your blood. So, your body thinks "Hey, my blood needs glucose. I need sugar(glucose). Feed me." [^13]

## ELI5: What are neural networks? Specifically RNNs.

> The little league team you coach just won the big game, and you ask them if they want to go out for pizza or for burgers. Each kid starts screaming their preference, and you go with whatever was the loudest.
>
> This is basically how a neural net works but on multiple levels. The top-level nodes get some input, each detects a certain property and screams when it sees it...the more intense the property, the louder they scream.
>
> Now you have a bunch of nodes screaming "it's dark!", "it's has red!", "it's roundish!" as various volumes. The next level listens and based on what they hear they start screaming about more complex features. "It has a face!", "It has fur", until finally get to a level where it is screaming "It's a kitty!".
>
> The magic part is no one tells them when to scream, it is based on feedback. Your little league team went for burgers, and some of them got sick. Next week, they might not scream for burgers, or might not scream as loudly. They have collectively learned that burgers might not have been a great choice, and are more likely to lean away from the option.
>
> A neural net gets training in much the same way. You feed it a bunch of kitty and non-kitty pictures. If the net gets it right, the nodes are reinforced so they are more likely to do the same thing in similar situations. If it is wrong, they get disincentivized. Initially, its results will be near random, but if you have designed it correctly, it will get better and better as the nodes adjust. You often have neural nets that work without any human understanding exactly how. [^14]

## ELI5: What is the difference between Alzheimer's and Dementia?

> Dementia is just the name give to the group of symptoms that include memory loss and loss of communication skills . Alzheimer's is one specific progressive disease of the brain that slowly causes impairment in memory and cognitive function. Alzheimer's is the most common disease that causes dementia but it's not the only one. [^15]
