## Notes

00:01:28

economy - how society uses scarse resources

00:01:56

attention - natural economy of the cyberspace

00:02:01

information consumes our attention to make it scare resource

00:02:13

attention is limited by time, so it's a fight for attention

00:02:46

politics - not about politics but attention
social network - unlimited scroll
videos - autoplay

00:02:54

forget information, it's all about relevance

00:03:03

unskippable adds for some seconds, catch attention

00:03:22

social networks run the attention economy, it's their bussines

00:03:47

they have algorithms to catch your attention and forbid you from leaving the site

00:04:00

love, like, sounds, colors

00:04:29

distractions breaks our focus (like text message)

00:04:36

> 23 minutes to resume focus after any interruption - Gloria Mark

00:04:55

and you will get interrupted more easily and often after the first interruption occurred

00:05:12

burst of dopamine from liking, swiping, refreshing

00:05:42

orwell and huxley quotes

00:05:48

- what orwell feared would be those who ban books
- what huxley feared there would be no reason to ban book, because nobody would read it anyway

00:05:57

- orwell feared those who would deprive us of information
- huxley feared those who would give us so much information, that would lead to passivity and egotism

00:06:06

- orwell feared the truth would be hidden from us
- huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance

00:06:28

attention economy is closer to huxley's vision

00:06:40

completely unplugging - fearing the consequences of missing out

00:06:50

figure out how to forbid current system to become huxley's nightmare

00:07:06

any good? - get any information in seconds

00:07:18

discover opinions, art, music, movies, anything

00:07:34

brought important issues to the front, which couldn't be done with classical media before

00:07:54

internet gives everyone a voice

00:08:19

internet makes it easy not to go out and meet, and replaces everyday interactions

00:08:47

we can contact anyone we ever met

00:08:54

exchange and share stuff easily, be more open about ourselves, chat and call over borders

00:09:10

attention economy causes infinite distractions, whether they are good or bad

00:09:30

source of money vs helping humans - how the distractions will be used

00:09:42

it's on us to fight easy distractions and form our opinions based on our own research, when the information is to easy to obtain

00:09:55

otherwise we get sucked into the attention economy

00:10:01

it's important to unplugged sometimes and enjoy life

00:10:12

world where we see everything but do nothing

00:10:18

and continue to amuse yourself till death
