## How to remember everything you learn

- illusions of competence
  1. seeing information in front of you doesn't mean you know it
  2. seeing/hearing someone come to conclusion doesn't mean you can get to conclusion as well
  3. searching on google is illusion that the information is in your brain
  4. spending lots of time with material doesn't mean you know it
- informed - I know what it is, but I can't explain it
- understands information - I'll explain it in depth
- when we consume media, we don't think about it or understand it, we just agree

> I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don't know the other side's argument better than they do - Charlie Munger

- long term memory - learning, organizing information
- working memory - filters what information gets into LTM
- information vanishes quickly in WM, when we don't use it more or repeatedly
- we can hold 2-4 things in WM
- when we get distracted we lose that information, and we need to get to it again
- too much information or too fast receiving - we don't remember anything
- we are not learning, just consuming and replacing old information by new one, and none gets to LTM
- information overload
- multitasking - similar to information overload
  - quickly switching from one task to another, so quickly switching information in WM, none gets to LTM
  - quickly switching tasks, tabs, receiving notifications
- fix: remove multitasking, distractions, information overload
- after that we can start learning
- techniques for learning

1. Recall
   - after consuming content, recall what you have learned, repeat it
   - recall after small chunks, not whole texts
   - read, recall, repeat
   - small chunks: chapters, parts of video, article
2. The Feynman Technique
   - best to understand something, but most work intensive
   - take something to understand
   - try to explain to someone who don't understand it
   - when stuck, go back to the material and relearn
   - until you can write the explanation without needing the source material
   - after that simplify the explanation, avoid complicated or technical language
   - until a kid can understand it
   - use of analogies
3. Spaced repetition
   - brain functions like a muscle
   - needs to be exercised to hold the information
   - more work with the information, stronger storage of it (stronger connections between neurons)
   - firing neurons over long period of time
   - spacing out the learning

Solution: do the above techniques over longer period of time repeatedly (like every 3rd day)

try to learn/focus on one thing at a time, instead of doing a lot of stuff and forgetting it all

> Our job is to find a few intelligent things to do, not keep up with every damn thing in the world - Charlie Munger

Increase the quality of the information you receive, not the quantity
