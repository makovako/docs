* LPT: If you are doing something and a young child asks to help, don't say "no" or "you're too little." Find a way to have them help, even if it's a distraction unrelated to your task, and thank them for helping. This develops positive self-esteem, mindfulness, collaboration, and gratitude. [^1]

* LPT: Learn to do — and enjoy — things by yourself. You’re going to miss out on a lot of fun if you keep waiting for someone else to accompany you. [^2]

* LPT: Your life doesn’t need to be special to be enjoyable. Having a regular job, food to eat and a roof over your head is more than almost every person who came before you or living now has had/have. Stop comparing yourself to crazy talented lucky people. [^3]

* LPT: Put a mirror behind you at the counter or at your desk. This way angry customers who approach you will have to see themselves in the mirror behind you and the chances of them behaving irrationally lowers significantly. No one wants to see themselves act like a dickhead. [^5]

* LPT: Don't think of accountants and lawyers as people you only need for taxes and trials. No: they're pretty much the only people who know the ACTUAL rules for how the world works. Think of them instead as people you can talk to before any big life decision.[^6]

* LPT: X percent of Y is equal to Y percent of X. So, if you want to find out what 7% of 50 is, you could instead find out what 50% of 7 is, which is 3.5. This means that 7% of 50 is also equal to 3.5. [^11]

* LPT: when your ISP raises your bill, call in and say “cancel service” to the automated operator. You’ll be sent to their retention team with no waiting on hold. They will usually take $10-20 off your monthly bill for a year. I do this once a year. [^12]

* LPT: never fill in those free raffles that you see in shopping centres giving away cool things like free holidays and free cars. These companies are data mining firms, and they pass on your information to call centres, marketing firms and even government agencies all without your permission. [^15]
