message signing with public/private keys explanation

[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIDL_akeras&t=192)

message signature can be used to verify message was signed by someones private key, uses public key for verification

[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIDL_akeras&t=252)

now transations will contain amount, 2 accounts = respective public keys and signature by the senders private key

[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIDL_akeras&t=369)

now this protects the blockchain information, because any change on blockchain is going to cause wrong signature to pop up, and it cannot be changed, because one who want's to change data doesn't have the private key of the sender

[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIDL_akeras&t=372)

cannot generate such a signature

there is no centralized authority for account creation, you only need public/private key pair
