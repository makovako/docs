> **Is it illegal to photograph the Tower at night?**
>
> Photographing the Eiffel Tower at night is not illegal at all. Any individual can take photos and share them on social networks.
>
> But the situation is different for professionals. The Eiffel Towerâ€™s lighting and sparkling lights are protected by copyright, so professional use of images of the Eiffel Tower at night require prior authorization and may be subject to a fee. Professionals should therefore contact the Eiffel Tower's management company to learn about conditions for using the images depending on the case.[^1]
