electricity travels through wires/conductors

[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=56)

stuff inside wire can transmit electricity from point a to b, stuff outside of wire can't transmit electrical force

[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=64)

analogy to water pipe

[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=83)

dc - system, positive and negative lead/end (like car battery)

[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=99)

connecting battery to an appliance, electricity can travel through this appliance

[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=119)

ac - alternating current, positive and negative are switching very fast

[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=125)

this causes electrical force to vibrate instead of flowing

[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=135)

vibration - force in wire vibrates, nto physicali, it's called oscilation

[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=170)

dc - like river, water moves
ac - like wave in the ocean, power moves but water does not

[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=186)

in ac nothing moves in the system, it just vibrates- goes back and forth in the medium

[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=197)

volts, amps, watts, to describe how much electric force is transmitted through the conductor

[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=201)

voltage - pressure or the force of electricity (energy potential)

[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=206)

amperage - hwo muc helectricity is going through the wire

[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=223)

analogy - voltage is pressure of the water in pipe/hose

[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=234)

volts - energy potential, how much energy is ready to be used

[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=241)

even when water hose is turned off, there is pressure, that water can be used

[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=247)

voltage- what appliances can be connectedd to the system

[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=260)

voltage- way to understand compatibility

[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=275)

amperage - how muc helectricity is flowing through the wire

[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=282)

how big wire needs to be, when attaching electrical components

[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=294)

water analogy, how thick the water hose is, how much water can we care, can flow through

[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=316)

if wire is not enough for given amperage, it will generate heat, energy must go somewhere

[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=320)

it can generate so much heat to cause a fire

[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=358)

watts- just a combination of volts and amps

[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=362)

watts = voltage x amperage

[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=367)

watts - total amount of electricity going through the system

[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=395)

water analogy, thinn hose with big pressure and thick hose with lwo presure, if they can fill same bucket in same time, they have the same wattage

[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=460)

example solar panel 10v x 1a = 10w
solar panel 1v x 10a = 10w
they provide they provide the same power, but the second one will need better wires

[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=545)

wattage gives an idea of how much power is something using

[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=550)

it's doesn't tells the compatibility, fuse size, wire size

[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=556)

only how much power overall it's generating or consuming

[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=572)

watthours - watage x hours
how much energy is used per time

[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=594)

how muc hpwoer is generated or consumed overtime

[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=600)

or how much electricity a battery can store

[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=611)

12 v x 100 ah = 1200 wh = 1,2 kwh

[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=640)

12v x 100 ah - it can produce 100 amps for an hour in 12 volts

[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=646)

amphour rating is at that specific voltage

[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=669)

watthours can tell how ong we can power appliances or how long it will take to charge the battery

[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=691)

1000 wh / 100 w load = 10 hours - we can power such appliance with given battery for 10 hours

[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=715)

work with watts and watthours to compare a calculate systems, volts and amps use just to get to that wattage figures

[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=753)

battery example - 250 amp hours at 24 volts can be converted to 500 amp hours at 12 volts (theoretically for comparison), thats why it's better to compare in watts

[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=768)

parallel and series connecting system components

[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=773)

when doing such connection, we can change the voltage and amperage of certain components

[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=779)

e.g. batteries and solar panels

[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=785)

parallel connection - connect all the psoitives and all the negatives

[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=802)

serial conection - daisy chaining - connect positive of one to negative of next one

[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=816)

parallel connaction - voltage stays the same, amperage or amp hours (e.g. battery) increases

[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=847)

series connection - voltage will increase, amperage or amp hours will stay the same

[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=886)

with this information, elctric systems (solar, batteries ...) can be designed

[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=926)

lets have 3 batteries 155 ah at 12 volts, in parallel we get 465 ah, this means 5580 watts hours, depending on the battery, in lead acid batteries we can use only half of the capacity, so 2790 watt hours usable

[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=950)

we will buy solar panels, 17,2 v x 5,82 amps = 101..1 watts

[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=954)

4 solar panels, will give 404,4 watts

[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=968)

we need solar charge controller, which is rated in amps

[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=977)

404.4 w / 12 v (we need this voltage for the batteries) = amp output of solar controller

[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=989)

we need 33.7 amps solar charge contorller, it needs to handle such current, that's why

[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1015)

how long it will take to charge

[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1024)

2790 wh of battery / 404.4 watts of sola = 6.89 hours to charge in ideal conditions

[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1034)

solar panels usually output 70% of rated wattage, let's calculate with that

[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1038)

404.4w x 0.7 = 283.08 w

[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1042)

realistically it will take 985 hours to racharge our battery

[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1065)

let's have 100 watt load, we can power it from batteries for 2790 wh battery / 100 watt load = 27.9 hours

[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1113)

lead acid batteries are meant to power for max 20 hours

[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1131)

fuse - small wire that heats up at certain amp rating

[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1135)

if more amps goes through it, it disconnects the wire

[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1148)

fuse - selfdestructive switch

[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1189)

let's calculate size of wire first

[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1194)

we need distance of the wire and amps that it needs to carry

[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1202)

then find on the internet what wire you need

[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1210)

now we want the size of the fuse to protect appliance and wire

[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1235)

usually it's best to have fuse of 125% size of what the appliances uses/needs

[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1256)

appliance map draw x 1.25 = fuse size

[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1279)

all wires create a little bit of heat, it has it's loss rating in percentages

[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1296)

if appliance is always connected make sure to have better wire than neccessary

[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1325)

the wire needs to carry enough amps to trip the fuse. if the wire is too small, the fuse will not blow and the wire becomes the fuse and overheats

[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1384)

battery -> fuse -> wire -> appliance (on the positive wire
)

[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1413)

try to use bigger wires than needed, there will be less losses and will be safer

[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4s-bxn4fs&t=1438)

when fuse is too close to the amperage being used, it will generate heat thus generate losses
