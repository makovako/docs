## To any of you confused by recursion, I found a really a good analogy

> Imagine you magically teleport into a movie theater and are placed in some arbitrary row. The seats in front of you are just high enough so that you cant see how many rows are in front of you.
>
> How do you figure out what row you are in?
>
> Tap the guy in front of you and ask him what row he is in and add 1 (1 row higher than the person in front). If he doesn't know, he will tap the person in front of him for his row. If the person in front of him doesn't know, he will ask the person in front of him... This will keep going on until you get to the person in the very first row of the theater and he will definitely know that he is in row 1, so he will tell the guy behind him that he is in row 1 and now the guy behind him knows he is in row 2. He tells the guy behind him that he is in row 2, so the guy behind knows that he is in row 3. As you keep going up the row starting from n, the guy above is in row n+1.
>
> This is exactly how recursion works. You have a method that may not give an exact answer yet, so it will recursively call the method again (usually with the input size being a little smaller) until the input meets some condition in the base case where it will return its value, and the calls behind it will each bubble up with its respective value until you reach the initial method call.

## Honeypot, an alternate to CAPTCHA.

> This approach will filter out some of the spam, yet it's not bullet proof. A few tips from my experience with honeypot fields:
>
> - display:none is not effective, most bots will know it's a honeypot, I noticed a position:absolute field out of the view port (left:-9999px) is much more effective
>
> - autocomplete="nope" - make sure autocomplete is off on bait field so legit submissions don't get caught when visitor uses browser's autofill, especially if the field name attribute is common i.e. "url" or "website"
>
> - tabindex="-1" - make sure the field can't be reached with keyboard navigation
>
> - try to validate some of the submitted data, i.e. if you have an email field you can check for basic formatting, check against a disposable email domains list (like mailinator), local part validation (anything@gmail should be >6 and <64 chars length)
>
> - don't show the honeypot as validation error, helps with targeted attacks as the spammer won't know they need to tweak the submission script [^8]
