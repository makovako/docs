## Benefits of privacy?

> This.

>

>
> 4. Revolutions happen
>
> 5. People "understand" the value of privacy

> 6. And then after lots of peaceful years and few generations, History (literally, read it) repeats at Step 1.[^1]

## Facebook data access

> Study shows that Facebook, Instagram and TikTok all collect face recognition, voice recognition, environment recognition, product recognition and language data, while accessing your contacts and image library. [^2] [^3]

> Responses to the "nothing to hide" argument: (most of these are copied from various places)
>
> - Saying you don't need privacy because you have nothing to hide is like saying you don't need free speech because you have nothing to say.
>
> - If you look hard enough at someone's life, a crime can always be found.
>
> - Saying you have nothing to hide is usually not true. This can apply to embarrassing details you'd rather people no know or minor legal things like getting all the speeding tickets you truly deserve (by the letter of the law, probably 95% of drivers would deserve several tickets every time they drove).
>
> - Even if you have never done anything wrong, there are situations and details in your life that could be used to prosecute, blackmail, or coerce you.
>
> - Privacy isn't about hiding wrongdoing, it's about protecting information.
>
> - Instead of saying "I have nothing to hide" therefore surveillance and data collection is fine, say "I have nothing to hide" therefore surveillance and data collection aren't needed.
>
> - You may trust the people/companies/governments that have access to your data now, but will you trust all people, all companies, and all governments whole will have access to your data for the rest of your life? Once it's out there, it can't be taken back. What happens if you're Jewish or gay and the next Hitler comes along?
>
> - If someone collects your info, it might get leaked at some point and cause a lot of damage or at least hassle.
>
> - If you have nothing to hide, put the following in a binder: all your login information to all your accounts, including your bank. Your SSN, driver's license number, everything. Copies of your tax returns, medical bills, investments and loans. Add a copy of your house key, car key, safety deposit box, work, mother's house and shed in the back. Now, hang this binder on your front door. Does this make you queasy?[^4]

## Was there ever a comment/quote/observation someone said in a podcast that stuck with you that you remember years later? what was it and why?

> "Google can change history & we wouldn't be able to tell" (or something like that) is something I never thought I'd hear on This Paranormal Life. It was a joke but goddamn does it hit harder than Lombardi "Liquid of the Dead" because of how true it is. We're so reliant on the internet for so much information that a troll or angry admin or ideologically-possessed person can rewrite history & most wouldn't bat an eye. Hell, it might've already happened & we didn't even notice [^5]
