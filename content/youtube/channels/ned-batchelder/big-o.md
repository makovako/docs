Big-O - how code slows as data grows

[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duvZ-2UK0fc&t=177)

not measuring time, length of the runtime, but trend over time

[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duvZ-2UK0fc&t=213)

10x data - progima can run the same, 2x/10x/100x..., thats' what Big-O want's to describe

O(blah blah N blah) - big o notation

[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duvZ-2UK0fc&t=256)

n - how much data you have

[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duvZ-2UK0fc&t=461)

O(n) - counting beans in a jar(s)
O(1) - having labels on jars of how many beans are in them

O(n) - find word in a book
O(log n) - find word in encyclopedia (it's alphabetically ordered), binary search

[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duvZ-2UK0fc&t=1002)

O(n) - every item in list
O(1) - list length when it is stored

[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duvZ-2UK0fc&t=1014)

O(1) - mydict[key]

[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duvZ-2UK0fc&t=1112)

In python:
O(1) - list append, list index
O(n) - val in list, for val in list
O(nlogn) - sort list
O(1) - dictionary key operations
O(n) - dictionary value cycling
O(1) - set add, lookup
O(n) - set cycle
