## Learning languages abroad

> Language classes. Many (most?) countries offer a 'language learning' visa where you can stay for a longer period of time if you can prove that you're taking classes to learn the national language. Do a google search for 'intensive language classes' in a language you'd like to learn, maybe adding a specific country or city where you'd like to study. Odds are that local universities or private language schools offer half- or full-time classes that will qualify you for a language learning visa.

> Protip: major world languages like French or Spanish may have the most geographically diverse options, but smaller languages may have more generous terms to come as a language student, including scholarships, housing, etc.[^1]
